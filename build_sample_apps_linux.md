# Intel® OpenVINO™ Toolkit <br>Build the Sample Applications on Linux*

The Inference Engine sample applications are simple console applications that demonstrate how to use Intel's Deep Learning Inference Engine in your applications.

### Samples included in the Samples Directory

The following sample applications are available in the samples directory in the Inference Engine installation directory:

| Sample Application  | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| CPU Extensions | Library with topology-specific layers, like `DetectionOutput` used in the SSDl  |
| Image Classification Sample | Inference of image classification networks like AlexNet and GoogLeNet (the sample supports only images as inputs) |

<br>

### Samples That Support Pre-Trained Models Shipped With the Product

You are provided several pre-trained models. The table below shows the correlation between models and samples/devices.  The samples are available in `<INSTALL_DIR>/deployment_tools/inference_engine/samples`
